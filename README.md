# RbxManager Plugins

Optional plugins for my [rbx-manager](https://github.com/zachariapopcorn/rbx-manager) project

To install a plugin, run the ``/plugin`` command with the name as the plugin's file name without the .ts extension

To submit a plugin, open a pull request with the desired plugin and a quick summary of what it does
